  "text": "Distance education, also known as distance learning, is the education of students who may not always be physically present at a school or where the learner and the teacher are separated in both time and distance. Traditionally, this usually involved correspondence courses wherein the student corresponded with the school via mail. Today, it usually involves online education and the learning is usually mediated by some form of technology. A distance learning program can be completely distance learning, or a combination of distance learning and traditional classroom instruction (called hybrid or blended).Other modalities include distance learning with complementary virtual environment or teaching in virtual environment."
